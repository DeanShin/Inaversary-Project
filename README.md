# Inaversary-Project
A little incremental game for our oshi's debut anniversary! 

## Folders

- documentation: any documentation/analysis of the app 
- inacremental: the actual app
- inacremental/src/components: folder for react components, the parts that will actually be displayed. Make sure these files end with .tsx!
- inacremental/src/services: folder for react services. The more functional logic of the game, makesure these files end with .ts!

## Contribution guide

Create a new branch when you start working on the project, this makes oversight much easier.

Write descriptive commit messages, explain what you changed.
Write comments when making new functions and components! If you looked something up, explain it in a comment too

Keep components pure. 
Don't clutter them with functions that are not part of the component directly or explained within the name

When installing packages, ensure you're in the inacremental folder!
